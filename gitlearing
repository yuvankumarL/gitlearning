1.
yuvan@yuvan:~/Desktop/project$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	name.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

-->this untracked file is the guests who are not clicked picture, but they came to marriage.

2.
yuvan@yuvan:~/Desktop/project$ git add name.txt
yuvan@yuvan:~/Desktop/project$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   name.txt

--> Now we can send the guests on the stage "git add .", here '.' reprsent the sending the whole persons in the queue to the stage. instead we can specify a name to send to the stage "git add name.txt"

yuvan@yuvan:~/Desktop/project$ git commit -m "name.txt file added"
